The International Collegiate Programming Contest is an algorithmic programming contest for college students. Teams of three, representing their university, work to solve the most real-world problems, fostering collaboration, creativity, innovation, and the ability to perform under pressure. Through training and competition, teams challenge each other to raise the bar on the possible. Quite simply, it is the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contest in the world.

# Introduction to CodeChef

## Codechef Style

- Long Challenge

CodeChef Long Challenge is a 10-day monthly coding contest where you can show off your computer programming skills. The significance being - it gives you enough time to think about a problem, try different ways of attacking the problem, read the concepts etc. If youâ€™re usually slow at solving problems and have ample time at hand, this is ideal for you. We also put in a lot of efforts in getting quality problems, which would, in turn, foster your learning while solving them.

- Cook-Off

CodeChef Cook-Off is a two and half hour coding contest where you can show off your computer programming skills.

- Lunch Time

CodeChef Lunchtime is a three hours coding contest where you can show off your computer programming skills.
